# Goal of this README

For the first few projects at 42, I have used Makefiles without fully understanding them, as I have realized is pretty common amongst my peers.  
At some point, we get a Makefile that works, and we keep using it because our main focus are the programs we are working on for our projects. This has led to some frustration, as I really don't like submitting work that features parts I haven't 100% understood.

The goals of this section is to study the documentation around Makefiles and the `make` utility, as well as the surrounding processes that I haven't necessarily made the effort to fully understand, like compilation.

I predict there will be a lot of sections identical to the official [GNU documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) but that is fine, it helps me learn and will, in the end, provide a curated resource for my needs.

The **end goal** of this first step is to write a working Makefile that is my own, and that I will be able to use for my upcoming 42 projects.  

### Requirements
- [ ] Be clearly written and divided into sections, the main one being the variables that are meant to be edited to customize the Makefile for each project and its needs.
- [ ] It should update my executable when any of the source files (including header files) is updated. (_I know that's what Makefiles **do**, but still._)
  - [ ] And update my executable when _any_ of the libraries it depends on is updated, especially when it's my own library with its own Makefile.
- [ ] Independently look for all the source files by itself in the necessary folders, avoiding me the task of listing them one by one. I know this can be done I just want to make it happen.
- [ ] I also want the Makefile to display colored messages that will help users understand what is going on (and be fun to look at).
- [ ] Maybe add some useful rules, like "debug" to compile with the `-g` flag, or `leaks` to use `debug` and then run `valgrind` on the program.

# Makefiles

The make program uses the makefile database and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.

**Concequences of updating files**
+ When make recompiles the editor, each changed C source file must be recompiled.  
+ If a header file has changed, each C source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe. Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file.  
+ Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable editor.

> Compilation is the process of translating the code you write into a language that is native to the machine you are targeting.

## Compilation steps

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
A[.c Code]-- Preprocessing -->B(["Pre-processed File (.i)"])
B-- Compilation -->C(["Assembly Code (.s)"])
C-- Assembly -->D(["Machine Code (.o, .obj)"])
D-- Linking -->E["Executable (.out)"]
```

## Preprocessing
In pre-processed (.i) files:
+ Header files are included
+ All Macros are resolved (replaced with their values)
+ Comments are removed.

You can see what your .i file looks like by running the following command to pre-process it:
```shell
$ gcc -E yourFile.c
```

This main.c file:
```C
#include "main.h"

#define MESSAGE "Bof."

/* This program prints a happy message */
int	main(void)
{
	printf("%s", MESSAGE);
	return (0);
}
```

and its corresponding .h file:
```C
#ifndef MAIN_H
# define MAIN_H

#include <stdio.h>

#endif
```

Would be pre-processed into this main.i file:
```C
# 400 "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/stdio.h" 2 3 4
# 5 "./main.h" 2
# 2 "main.c" 2

int main(void)
{
 printf("%s", "Bof.");
 return (0);
}
```

## Compilation

Compilation takes pre-processed files as input, and converts this high-level source code into **assembly instructions**, which are **specific to the target processor architecture**.

It generates a .s file.

You can generate this file with the following command:
```shell
$ gcc -S yourFile.c
# This will run the preprocessor (cpp) over yourFile.c, perform the initial compilation and then stop before the assembler is run.
```

The .s file of my main.c looks like this:
```c
	.section	__TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions
	.build_version macos, 12, 0	sdk_version 12, 0
	.globl	_main                           ## -- Begin function main
	.p2align	4, 0x90
_main:                                  ## @main
	.cfi_startproc
## %bb.0:
	pushq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	.cfi_offset %rbp, -16
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp
	subq	$16, %rsp
	movl	$0, -4(%rbp)
	leaq	L_.str(%rip), %rdi
	leaq	L_.str.1(%rip), %rsi
	movb	$0, %al
	callq	_printf
	xorl	%eax, %eax
	addq	$16, %rsp
	popq	%rbp
	retq
	.cfi_endproc
                                        ## -- End function
	.section	__TEXT,__cstring,cstring_literals
L_.str:                                 ## @.str
	.asciz	"%s"

L_.str.1:                               ## @.str.1
	.asciz	"Bof."

.subsections_via_symbols
```

## Assembly

Converts the assembly instructions that resulted from the compilation, and generated **object code** with .o extension.

The output consists of actual instructions to be run by the target processor.

You can generate .o files with the following command:

```shell
$ gcc -c yourFile.c
```

The following file might look like something like this:

![.o file](img/o_file.jpg)

## Linking

Until now we have only included header files, which contain function declarations, like the `printf()` used in our program, which still has no definition.  
It will be defined in the corresponding library files.

So **Linking** is the final stage of compilation, it takes all the **static libraries** and **object files** and generates a **single executable**.  
This executable extension will be `.out` on Linux platforms, and `.exe` on windows platforms.

## What a Makefile Rule looks like

```makefile
target ... : prerequisites ...
    recipe
    ...
    ...
```

**Target**  
Usually the name of a file that is generated by a program. It can also be the name of an action to carry out, like `clean`.  

**Prerequisites**  
Files that are used as input to create the target. A target often needs several files.  

**Recipe**  
An action that `make` carries out. A recipe can have one or several commands on individual lines.  

ðŸš¨ All recipes must begin with a `TAB` character ! That's how the makefile differentiates recipes from the other lines in the Makefile.

> Not all Makefile rules need prerequisites. For example, the rule containing the delete command associated with the target `clean` does not have prerequisites.
> 
> The target â€˜cleanâ€™ is not a file, but merely the name of an action. Since you normally do not want to carry out the actions in this rule, â€˜cleanâ€™ is not a prerequisite of any other rule. Consequently, make never does anything with it unless you tell it specifically. Note that this rule not only is not a prerequisite, it also does not have any prerequisites, so the only purpose of the rule is to run the specified recipe.

## How `make` processes a Makefile

Here is a simple Makefile:

```Makefile
edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
       insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
        cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
                   insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

main.o : main.c defs.h
        cc -c main.c
kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c kbd.c
command.o : command.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c command.c
display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c display.c
insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c insert.c
search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c search.c
files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h
        cc -c files.c
utils.o : utils.c defs.h
        cc -c utils.c
clean :
        rm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
           insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
```

By default, `make` starts with the first target. This is called the _detault goal_.

> Goals are the targets that `make` strives ultimately to update.

In a simple Makefile, the default goal is to _update_ the executable generated, here the executable program `edit`.

`make` reads the makefile in the current directory and begins by processing the first rule.  
In this example, this rule is for relinking `edit`, but before `make` can fully process this rule, it must process the rules for the files that `edit` depends on, which in this case are the object files.  
Each of these files is processed according to its own rule. These rules say to update each `.o` file by compiling its source file. The recompilation must be done if the source file, or any of the header files named as prerequisites, is more recent than the object file, or if the object file does not exist.

The other rules are processed because their targets appear as prerequisites of the goal. If some other rule is not depended on by the goal, that rule is not processed, unless you tell `make` to do so (with a command such as `make clean`).

**Before recompiling** an object file, `make` considers updating its prerequisites: the source file and header files. This makefile does not specify anything to be done for themâ€“the `.c` and `.h` files are not the targets of any rulesâ€“ so `make` does nothing for these files. But it would update automatically generated C programs, by their own rules at this time.

**After recompiling** whichever object files need it, `make` decides whether to relink `edit`. This must be done if the file `edit` does not exist, or if any of the object files are newer than it. If an object file was just recompiled, it is now newer than `edit`, so `edit` is relinked.
