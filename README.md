# Goal of this README

For the first few projects at 42, I have used Makefiles without fully understanding them, as I have realized is pretty common amongst my peers.  
At some point, we get a Makefile that works, and we keep using it because our main focus are the programs we are working on for our projects. This has led to some frustration, as I really don't like submitting work that features parts I haven't 100% understood, and I also need to be able to fix things that do not work as expected.

The goals of this section is to study the documentation around Makefiles and the `make` utility, as well as the surrounding processes that I haven't necessarily made the effort to fully understand, like compilation.

I predict there will be a lot of sections identical to the official [GNU documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) but that is fine, it helps me learn and will, in the end, provide a curated resource for my needs.

The **end goal** of this first step is to build a solid understanding of Makefiles, and use it to write a working Makefile that is my own, and that I will be able to use for my upcoming 42 projects.  

### Requirements for this Makefile
- [ ] Be clearly written and divided into sections, the main one being the variables that are meant to be edited to customize the Makefile for each project and its needs.
- [ ] It should update my executable when any of the source files (including header files) is updated. (_I know that's what Makefiles **do**, but still._)
  - [ ] And update my executable when _any_ of the libraries it depends on is updated, especially when it's my own library with its own Makefile.
- [ ] Independently look for all the source files by itself in the necessary folders, avoiding me the task of listing them one by one. I know this can be done I just want to make it happen.
- [ ] I also want the Makefile to display colored messages that will help users understand what is going on (and be fun to look at).
- [ ] Maybe add some useful rules, like "debug" to compile with the `-g` flag, or `leaks` to use `debug` and then run `valgrind` on the program.
  - I could also add a few commands that run Valgrind and grep a possible '0 leaks' output and then outputs either "No leaks found", or the valgrind output if leaks are actually found.
    - This could be called `make harriet` ðŸ”Ž

# Now let's learn about Makefiles

The make program uses the makefile database and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.

**Concequences of updating files**
+ When make recompiles the editor, each changed C source file must be recompiled.  
+ If a header file has changed, each C source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe. Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file.  
+ Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable editor.

> Compilation is the process of translating the code you write into a language that is native to the machine you are targeting.

## Compilation steps

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
A[.c Code]-- Preprocessing -->B(["Pre-processed File (.i)"])
B-- Compilation -->C(["Assembly Code (.s)"])
C-- Assembly -->D(["Machine Code (.o, .obj)"])
D-- Linking -->E["Executable (.out)"]
```

## Preprocessing
In pre-processed (.i) files:
+ Header files are included
+ All Macros are resolved (replaced with their values)
+ Comments are removed.

You can see what your .i file looks like by running the following command to pre-process it:
```shell
$ gcc -E yourFile.c
```

This main.c file:
```C
#include "main.h"

#define MESSAGE "Bof."

/* This program prints a happy message */
int	main(void)
{
	printf("%s", MESSAGE);
	return (0);
}
```

and its corresponding .h file:
```C
#ifndef MAIN_H
# define MAIN_H

#include <stdio.h>

#endif
```

Would be pre-processed into this main.i file:
```C
# 400 "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/stdio.h" 2 3 4
# 5 "./main.h" 2
# 2 "main.c" 2

int main(void)
{
 printf("%s", "Bof.");
 return (0);
}
```

## Compilation

Compilation takes pre-processed files as input, and converts this high-level source code into **assembly instructions**, which are **specific to the target processor architecture**.

It generates a .s file.

You can generate this file with the following command:
```shell
$ gcc -S yourFile.c
# This will run the preprocessor (cpp) over yourFile.c, perform the initial compilation and then stop before the assembler is run.
```

The .s file of my main.c looks like this:
```c
	.section	__TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions
	.build_version macos, 12, 0	sdk_version 12, 0
	.globl	_main                           ## -- Begin function main
	.p2align	4, 0x90
_main:                                  ## @main
	.cfi_startproc
## %bb.0:
	pushq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	.cfi_offset %rbp, -16
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp
	subq	$16, %rsp
	movl	$0, -4(%rbp)
	leaq	L_.str(%rip), %rdi
	leaq	L_.str.1(%rip), %rsi
	movb	$0, %al
	callq	_printf
	xorl	%eax, %eax
	addq	$16, %rsp
	popq	%rbp
	retq
	.cfi_endproc
                                        ## -- End function
	.section	__TEXT,__cstring,cstring_literals
L_.str:                                 ## @.str
	.asciz	"%s"

L_.str.1:                               ## @.str.1
	.asciz	"Bof."

.subsections_via_symbols
```

## Assembly

Converts the assembly instructions that resulted from the compilation, and generated **object code** with .o extension.

The output consists of actual instructions to be run by the target processor.

You can generate .o files with the following command:

```shell
$ gcc -c yourFile.c
```

The following file might look like something like this:

![.o file](img/o_file.jpg)

## Linking

Until now we have only included header files, which contain function declarations, like the `printf()` used in our program, which still has no definition.  
It will be defined in the corresponding library files.

So **Linking** is the final stage of compilation, it takes all the **static libraries** and **object files** and generates a **single executable**.  
This executable extension will be `.out` on Linux platforms, and `.exe` on windows platforms.

## What a Makefile Rule looks like

```makefile
target ... : prerequisites ...
	recipe
	...
	...
```

**Target**  
Usually the name of a file that is generated by a program. It can also be the name of an action to carry out, like `clean`.  

**Prerequisites**  
Files that are used as input to create the target. A target often needs several files.  

**Recipe**  
An action that `make` carries out. A recipe can have one or several commands on individual lines.  

ðŸš¨ All recipes must begin with a `TAB` character ! That's how the makefile differentiates recipes from the other lines in the Makefile.

> Not all Makefile rules need prerequisites. For example, the rule containing the delete command associated with the target `clean` does not have prerequisites.
> 
> The target â€˜cleanâ€™ is not a file, but merely the name of an action. Since you normally do not want to carry out the actions in this rule, â€˜cleanâ€™ is not a prerequisite of any other rule. Consequently, make never does anything with it unless you tell it specifically. Note that this rule not only is not a prerequisite, it also does not have any prerequisites, so the only purpose of the rule is to run the specified recipe.

## How `make` processes a Makefile

Here is a simple Makefile:

```Makefile
edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
       insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
        cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
                   insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

main.o : main.c defs.h
        cc -c main.c
kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c kbd.c
command.o : command.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c command.c
display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c display.c
insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c insert.c
search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c search.c
files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h
        cc -c files.c
utils.o : utils.c defs.h
        cc -c utils.c
clean :
        rm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
           insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
```

By default, `make` starts with the first target. This is called the _detault goal_.

> Goals are the targets that `make` strives ultimately to update.

In a simple Makefile, the default goal is to _update_ the executable generated, here the executable program `edit`.

`make` reads the makefile in the current directory and begins by processing the first rule.  
In this example, this rule is for relinking `edit`, but before `make` can fully process this rule, it must process the rules for the files that `edit` depends on, which in this case are the object files.  
Each of these files is processed according to its own rule. These rules say to update each `.o` file by compiling its source file. The recompilation must be done if the source file, or any of the header files named as prerequisites, is more recent than the object file, or if the object file does not exist.

The other rules are processed because their targets appear as prerequisites of the goal. If some other rule is not depended on by the goal, that rule is not processed, unless you tell `make` to do so (with a command such as `make clean`).

**Before recompiling** an object file, `make` considers updating its prerequisites: the source file and header files. This makefile does not specify anything to be done for themâ€“the `.c` and `.h` files are not the targets of any rulesâ€“ so `make` does nothing for these files. But it would update automatically generated C programs, by their own rules at this time.

**After recompiling** whichever object files need it, `make` decides whether to relink `edit`. This must be done if the file `edit` does not exist, or if any of the object files are newer than it. If an object file was just recompiled, it is now newer than `edit`, so `edit` is relinked.

Thus, if we change the file `insert.c` and run `make`, make will compile that file to update `insert.o`, and then link `edit`. If we change the file `command.h` and run `make`, `make` will recompile the object files `kbd.o`, `command.o` and `files.o` and then link the file `edit`.

## Using Variables to make Makefiles simpler

In the above example, we had to list all the object files twice in the rule for `edit`:

```makefile
edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
		insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
		cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
			insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
```

This can lead to errors; if a new object file is added to the system, we might add it to one list and not the other.
We can eliminate that risk by using a variable.

> Variables allow a text string to be defined once and substituted in multiple places later.

It is standard practice for every makefile to have a variable named `objects`, `objs`, `OBJS`, `obj` or `OBJ`, which is a list of all object file names.  

We would define such a variable with a line like this in the Makefile:
```makefile
objects = main.p kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
```
Then, each place we want to put a list of the object file names, we can substitute the variable's value by writing `$(objects)`.

Here is the same makefile but with a variable used for the object files:

```makefile
objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)
main.o : main.c defs.h
        cc -c main.c
kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c kbd.c
command.o : command.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c command.c
display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c display.c
insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c insert.c
search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c search.c
files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h
        cc -c files.c
utils.o : utils.c defs.h
        cc -c utils.c
clean :
        rm edit $(objects)
```

## Letting `make` deduce the Recipes

It is not necessary to spell out the recipes for compiling the individual C source files, because `make` can figure them out: it has an _implicit rule_ for updating a `.o` file from a correspondingly named `.c` file using a `cc -c` command.  

For example, it will use the recipe `cc -c main.c -o main.o` to compile `main.c` into `main.o`.
We can therefore omit the recipes from the rules for the object files.

When a `.c` file is used automatically in this way, it is also automatically added to the list of prerequisites. We can therefore omit the `.c` files from the prerequisites, provided we omit the recipe.

Here is the entire example, with both of these changes, and a variable `objects` as suggested above:

```makefile
objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)

main.o : defs.h
kbd.o : defs.h command.h
command.o : defs.h command.h
display.o : defs.h buffer.h
insert.o : defs.h buffer.h
search.o : defs.h buffer.h
files.o : defs.h buffer.h command.h
utils.o : defs.h

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm edit $(objects)
```

This is how we would write the Makefile in actual practice. (The complications associated with `clean` are described elsewhere, see GNU documentation)

Because implicit rules are so convenient, they are important. They are used frequently.

## Another Style of Makefile (the one we use at 42)

When objects of a Makefile are created only by implicit rules, an alternative style of Makefile is possible.  
In this style of Makefile, you group entries by their prerequisites instead of by their targets.

Here is what this one looks like:

```makefile
objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)

$(objects) : defs.h
kbd.o command.o files.o : command.h
display.o insert.o search.o files.o : buffer.h
```

Here, `defs.h` is given as a prerequisite of all the object files.  
`command.h` and `buffer.h` are prerequisites of the specific object files listed for them.

Whether this is better is a matter of taste: it is more compact, but some people dislike it because they find it clearer to put all the information about each target in one place.

## Rules for cleaning the directory

Makefiles commonly specify how to do a few other things besides compiling a program.  
For example: how to delete all the object files and executables so that the directory is `clean`.

Here is how we could write a `make` rule for cleaning our example editor:

```makefile
clean:
	rm edit $(objects)
```

In practice, we might want to write the rule in a somewhat more complicated manner to handle unanticipated situations.  
We would do this:

```Makefile
.PHONY : clean
clean :
	-rm edit $(objects)
```

This prevents `make` from getting confused by an actual file called `clean` and causes it to continue in spite of errors from `rm`.

This kind of rule **should not** be placed at the beginning of the Makefile, because we do not want it to run by default !
Thus, in the example Makefile, we want the rule for `edit`, which recompiles the editor, to remain the _default goal_.

Since `clean` is not a prerequisite of `edit`, this rule will not run at all if we give the command `make` with no arguments.  
In order to make the rule run, we have to type `make clean`.

## Writing Makefiles

[Writing Makefiles, GNU Doc](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefiles).

Interesting things:

### Splitting lines

You can use a \ at the end of a line to split it. But they are handled differently whether the statement is a recipe line or not.

Essentially, in contrast to how they are treated in other places in a makefile (see [Splitting Recipe Lines](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Splitting-Recipe-Lines)), backslash/newline pairs are not removed from the recipe. Both the backslash and the newline characters are preserved and **passed to the shell**. How the backslash/newline is interpreted depends on your shell. If the first character of the next line after the backslash/newline is the recipe prefix character (a tab by default; see Special Variables), then that character (and only that character) is removed. Whitespace is never added to the recipe. 

Outside of recipe lines, backslash/newlines are converted into a single space character. Once that is done, all whitespace around the backslash/newline is condensed into a single space: this includes all whitespace preceding the backslash, all whitespace at the beginning of the line after the backslash/newline, and any consecutive backslash/newline combinations.

### Naming the Makefile

By default, when `make` looks for the makefile, it tries the following names, in order:  
`GNUmakefile`, `makefile`, and `Makefile`.

Normally you should call your makefile either `makefile` or `Makefile`. (We recommend `Makefile` because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files such as README.)  

The first name checked, `GNUmakefile`, is not recommended for most makefiles. 

## Including Other Makefiles

The `include` directive tells `make` to suspend reading the current Makefile and read one or more other Makefiles before continuing.

The directive is a line in the Makefile that looks like this:

```makefile
include filenamesâ€¦
```

_filenames_ can contain shell file name patterns. If it is empty, nothing is included and no error is printed.

Whitespace is required between include and the file names, and between the file names; extra whitespace is ignored.

For example, if you have three `.mk` files (`a.mk`, `b.mk`, `c.mk`) and `$(bar)` expands to "bish bash", then the following:

```makefile
include foo *.mk $(bar)
```

is equivalent to

```makefile
include foo a.mk b.mk c.mk bish bash
```

If you want make to simply ignore a makefile which does not exist or cannot be remade, with no error message, use the `-include` directive instead of `include`, like this:

```makefile
-include filenames...
```

This acts like include in every way except that there is no error (not even a warning) if any of the filenames (or any prerequisites of any of the filenames) do not exist or cannot be remade.

For compatibility with some other make implementations, `sinclude` is another name for `-include`.
